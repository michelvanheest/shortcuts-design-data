## Introduction

Hi all, I'm [Michel](https://twitter.com/michelvanheest) and I'm a Interaction and UX design student. In November 2017, I launched [Shortcuts.design](http://shortcuts.design/).

Shortcuts.design is a small website that lists every shortcut a designer ever wants to know, all designapps in one place and in a simple and clear way. It's very usefull for beginning designers to quickly charge their workflow, when you switched to a new designtool or when you just want a reference to see which shortcut to use for that action you have to do all day long.
